// Params represent the Gravity genesis and store parameters
// gravity_id:
// a random 32 byte value to prevent signature reuse, for example if the
// cosmos validators decided to use the same Ethereum keys for another chain
// also running Gravity we would not want it to be possible to play a deposit
// from chain A back on chain B's Gravity. This value IS USED ON ETHEREUM so
// it must be set in your genesis.json before launch and not changed after
// deploying Gravity
//
// contract_hash:
// the code hash of a known good version of the Gravity contract
// solidity code. This can be used to verify the correct version
// of the contract has been deployed. This is a reference value for
// goernance action only it is never read by any Gravity code
//
// bridge_ethereum_address:
// is address of the bridge contract on the Ethereum side, this is a
// reference value for governance only and is not actually used by any
// Gravity code
//
// bridge_chain_id:
// the unique identifier of the Ethereum chain, this is a reference value
// only and is not actually used by any Gravity code
//
// These reference values may be used by future Gravity client implemetnations
// to allow for saftey features or convenience features like the Gravity address
// in your relayer. A relayer would require a configured Gravity address if
// governance had not set the address on the chain it was relaying for.
//
// signed_valsets_window
// signed_batches_window
// signed_claims_window
//
// These values represent the time in blocks that a validator has to submit
// a signature for a batch or valset, or to submit a claim for a particular
// attestation nonce. In the case of attestations this clock starts when the
// attestation is created, but only allows for slashing once the event has passed
//
// target_batch_timeout:
//
// This is the 'target' value for when batches time out, this is a target becuase
// Ethereum is a probabalistic chain and you can't say for sure what the block
// frequency is ahead of time.
//
// average_block_time
// average_ethereum_block_time
//
// These values are the average Cosmos block time and Ethereum block time repsectively
// and they are used to copute what the target batch timeout is. It is important that
// governance updates these in case of any major, prolonged change in the time it takes
// to produce a block
//
// slash_fraction_valset
// slash_fraction_batch
// slash_fraction_claim
// slash_fraction_conflicting_claim
//
// The slashing fractions for the various gravity related slashing conditions. The first three
// refer to not submitting a particular message, the third for submitting a different claim
// for the same Ethereum event
